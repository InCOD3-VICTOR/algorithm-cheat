# TODO

GPU / GPU benchmarks. Basically, they tell you which algorithms industry really cares about:

-   SPEC2017: https://www.spec.org/cpu2017/Docs/index.html#benchmarks

Algorithms that could be included:

-   <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2113795/quickest-way-to-find-missing-number-in-an-array-of-numbers>

    Find the missing number of an increasing sequence that has been mixed up.

    E.g., start with:

        1 2 3 4 5 6

    Mix up:

        6 3 5 4 2 1

    Remove an unknown number:

        6 5 4 2 1

    Which number was removed?

    Solution: sum up, use the sum formula, take difference.

-   <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3492302/easy-interview-question-got-harder-given-numbers-1-100-find-the-missing-numbe>

    Same as above, but remove 2 numbers instead.

-   <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1586858/find-the-smallest-integer-not-in-a-list>

    Find the smallest non-negative integer *not* in an unsorted array of length `N`.

    The array is stored in RAM.

    Application: generate unique IDs in a system where any ID can be removed.

    Solution intuition:

    - `N` is the largest possible value in case of an increasing sequence. This means that you can throw away any number larger than `N`.
    - if the array were sorted, it would be easy.
    - there are non-comparison sorting algorithms for integers in a fixed range that perform $O(N)$ time $O(1)$ memory.

    Solution: 2 passes, first try to put every number smaller than `N` in the array position with same value as the number. If already occupied by another number, do the same for the other number. Throw away anything larger than `N`.

-   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_problem>. Partition a multiset into two sub-multisets such that the sum of each sub-multiset is equal. NP-complete.

    Many not have a solution, which leads to the optimization version: minimize the difference. NP-hard.

-   TODO: Sort search results with multiple fields of different importance. E.g.: title and summary.

Error correction:

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check> CRC

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming%287,4%29>

    Interesting, it has a matrix representation!

    TODO: what does it mean that it is linear?

-   As mentioned at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction>, error correction is much more useful for multicast, where it would be impractical for all receivers to request a correction.

    TODO vs Hamming code? <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_code#Hamming_code> Many Hamming codes are also CRC. TODO: is there any advantage for those that are not?

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction> Used in most modern optic and magnetic media.

-   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code> Some error checking can also deal with erasure.
